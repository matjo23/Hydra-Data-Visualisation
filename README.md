Overview
This is a creative data visualisation project where you are encouraged to explore different creative outputs, aesthetics and interactions. Good data visualisation requires digital design and storytelling skills in addition to strong analytical skills. You will work with the raw transcribed data from the Craiglockhart War Hospital of the ~1800 Officers who were treated there during the First World War.

Today the hospital is famous for being where Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon (two of the most iconic war poets) met in the Summer of 1917. However, the hospital also treated a large number of other officers and the data from the Hospital Records was transcribed into an Excel spreadsheet with ~65,000 data points. Examples of creative data visualisation approaches can be seen in the work by Neil Halloran, you can see his YouTube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/c/NeilHalloran. His work of the Fallen of World War II is available here: http://www.fallen.io/ww2/. This project is smaller scale but requires a considered approach in transforming the raw data into meaningful insights.

The overarching aim is to create an interactive and engaging visualisations that can demonstrate how to make sense of an underused dataset. The dataset offers a rich opportunity for visualisation, allowing for analysis across various dimensions, with the potential to highlight new information, differences between groups, or correlations between variables.

Deliverables
Data Preparation & Cleaning: A thorough review of the dataset will be required to clean and prepare it for visualisation. This includes: Identifying missing or incorrect data; Formatting data into appropriate types (e.g., dates, numbers, categorical values); Removing duplicates or irrelevant rows; Creating new data features, if needed, to enhance the analysis
Visualisation Development: Several types of visualisations will be created based on the nature of the dataset. These will be up to the team to consider but could include: Sankey Diagrams: To emphasise flow/movement/change from one state to another; Bar Charts: To represent categorical data, such as officers by regiment or by region; Line Graphs: To show trends over time, such as when admitted or discharged; Heatmaps: To visualise correlations or the intensity of certain variables across the dataset
Interactive Elements or Dashboard: Users should be able to filter data based on key variables, explore subgroups, and customise views to gain more granular insights. Filters and Sliders: To narrow down the data based on date ranges, categories, or other dimensions; Tooltips and Hover Effects: To provide additional information about specific data points when hovering over them; Zooming and Panning: For datasets with spatial or temporal components, allowing users to focus on particular areas of interest
Technologies and Tools: The platform will be built using modern tools and frameworks for data visualization, such as: Unity, D3.js or Plotly for interactive visualisations; Tableau or Power BI for dashboard creation; Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data analysis and preprocessing; HTML, CSS, JavaScript for web-based deployment of visualisations
User Testing and Refinement: Once the initial visualisations are developed, they should be tested with end users or stakeholders to gather feedback on functionality, usability, and clarity. This feedback will inform any necessary refinements to the visualisations or interface
Timeline: The project is expected to take approximately Trimester 2 to prototype: Weeks 1-4: Design, Research, Data Cleaning and Preparation; Weeks 5-10: Development of Visualizations and Prototyping; Weeks 11-14: Testing, refinement, and user feedback integration.
Expected Outcomes: by the end of the project, the following deliverables will be produced: An interactive, user-friendly visualisation that uses the dataset to tell an engaging story; Several dynamic visualisations for users to explore.
Documentation and guidelines for the use of the platform, ensuring that users can navigate and interpret the visualisations effectively; Stretch-goal: A video or motion graphic to convey the project to external audiences
